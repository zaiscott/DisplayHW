            <dt>Shape</dt>
            <dd> Indicates the spread of the data, where the mean 
              lies, its variability, and possibly what the range of the data set is.</dd>
            <dt>Outliers</dt>
            <dd> is a data point that differs significantly from other data points, which can be a result of experimental error. Outliers can cause problems in situations of analysis of the data.</dd>
