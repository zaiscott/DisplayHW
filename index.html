    <h1>Displaying Distributions</h1>
    
        <p>Cairo uses the term, "Distribution" to refer to all of the values of a data set together which is typically shown by a graph. Other things that Cairo discussed in the chapter was the 4 elemts of a distribution that help descibe the data:
            <br>
            
        
            <dt>Level</dt>
            <dd> Another term for the measures of central tendency, which help give an estamation on sizes of numbers and the center point.
              
            <dt>Spread</dt>
            <dd> Tells how wide the set of data is which helps indicate the range, stadard deviation, quatiles, and variances.</dd>
            <dt>Shape</dt>
            <dd> Indicates the spread of the data, where the mean 
              lies, its variability, and possibly what the range of the data set is.</dd>
            <dt>Outliers</dt>
            <dd> is a data point that differs significantly from other data points, which can be a result of experimental error. Outliers can cause problems in situations of analysis of the data.</dd>
